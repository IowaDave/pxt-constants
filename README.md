# pxt-constants
### A MakeCode extension package providing a selection of constant-valued "reporter" blocks 

These custom blocks are intended to overcome one or both of two design limitations in the MakeCode standard blocks:
1. Standard blocks do not support the legal TypeScript (JavaScript) declaration, "const"
1. The "Math.xx" constants available to TypeScript convert to gray blocks but are not directly selectable as standard blocks

The limitations are understandable as balancing the desire for a useful subset of the Static TypeScript language while minimizing the learning burden for persons at the entry-level of coding.

Custom blocks offer a solution for coders having gained some experience, who prefer to use the block-oriented MakeCode editor but desire access to more features of the TypeScript language.
